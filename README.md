# Moving_Object_Removal

A novel application of temporal video data to remove moving objects and return a static background. 

Utilizes consecutive frames in video with a convolutional net to generate a mask of the moving objects.
Processes these maps and uses image inpainting to return a complete background.

Please see the PDF file for a more in depth explaination of my approach.
